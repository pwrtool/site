# Powertool

Powertool is a tool for building and running scripts. It can be used for:
- Power users
- Developers
- CI/CD Pipelines
- And more

You can use any language you want (although some may have more tooling than others), and automate anything you want. Powertools can be run locally and in the cloud.
