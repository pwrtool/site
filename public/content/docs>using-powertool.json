If you're on windows, consider using [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).\n\n## Quick Install\n\nWe're still working on a one line install. Stay tuned!\n\n## Manual Install\n\nTo run powertool, you'll need [bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). You can install bun with\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash\n```\n\nNow clone the repo somewhere convenient. I'll assume that you have git installed. I'll put it in my `/usr/local/powertool` folder:\n\n```bash\nsudo git clone https://github.com/pwrtool/powertool.git /usr/local/powertool/\n```\n\nYou'll then need to add the bin folder to your path. If you put it in your `/usr/local/powertool` folder, that path would be `/usr/local/powertool/bin`. You'll want something like the following inm your `.bashrc`, `.profile`, `.zshrc` or whatever:\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/powertool/bin\n```\n\nNow ensure that the installation worked properly:\n\n```bash\npwrtool --help\n```\n\nThis should display a help message that looks like the following:\n\n```txt\nUsage: pwrtool [options] [command]\n\nAutomate every aspect of your workflow\n\nOptions:\n  -V, --version    output the version number\n  -h, --help       display help for command\n\nCommands:\n  install <kit>    Install a tool from Github to your system\n  update <kit>     uninstalls and reinstalls a kit to ensure it is up to date\n  uninstall <kit>  Uninstall a tool from your system\n  test-install     Installs ./install.sh as a kit to the test-kit directory. You can then run\n                   `ptx bench/test <tool>` to test your kit. This is primarily useful for\n                   developing kits\n  info <kit>       Get information about a kit from its ptinfo.yaml file\n```\n\n# Installing Kits\n\nIt's recommended that you install the `pwrtool/std` kit. Run the following command:\n\n```bash\npwrtool install pwrtool/std\n```\n\n`pwrtool install` looks for the github repo from the user or organization `pwrtool` with the name `std` and clones it. All of the building of the kit is done straight from the source to minimize issues of it not working on different machines.\n\nIf you want to know the capabilities of a kit, just run `pwrtool info`:\n\n```bash\npwrtool infoo pwrtool/std\n```\n\nThis contains tools for building new kits, running those kits, and some basic \"hello world\" and example stuff.\n","outline":[{"text":"Installing the CLI","level":1},{"text":"Quick Install","level":2},{"text":"Manual Install","level":2},{"text":"Installing Kits","level":1}],"extension":"md","frontmatter":{"title":"Using Powertool"}}
